						<a>Which tools / applications were used and why?</a>
						<p>-The tools I used to create my interactive animation was</p>
						<p>Photoshop - For drawing all the sprites need in the animation.</p>
						<p>Illustrator - For drawing shapes and simple objects.</p>
						<p>Animate - For animating the sprites and making the animation interactive.</p>
						<br>

						<a>How you used the features of these tools / applications?</a>		
						<p>-I used: </p>
						<p>Photoshop for drawing all of the sprites I used in my game.</p>
						<p>I used layers to draw parts so they would not overlap or have to be drawn in a particular order.</p>
						<p>Drawing on different layers allowed me to edit parts of a drawing without affecting the other parts of the drawing.</p>

						<p>Illustrator - For drawing the shape of the Arrow</p>
						<p>I used path tools </p>


						<p>Animate - </p>
						<p>I created a Movie Clip for each direction the character faces and inside the Movie Clip I changed the sprite to make it look like he is walking.</p>
						<p>I used the Motion Tween to move the character around the screen</p>
						<p>I used the Animate Code snippets to get the buttons to work when they were clicked on.</p>
						<img src="ProjectImages/snippet.png" alt="">
						<p>I wrote some code in the editor so that the collectables would not appear multiple times</p>
						<p>I did this by setting some variables and checking if they had been collected or not</p>
						<p>The animation would then go to the correct frame</p>

						<a>Why you believe your use of tools / applications was competent</a>		
						<p>-</p>
						<br>

						<a>How you exported your work and why you did it that way</a>
						<p>-Photoshop</p>
						<p>I exported all of my drawings all as a .png</p>
						<p>I did this because I wanted the quality of my drawings to be...</p>
						<p>I also wanted the background to be transparent.</p>

						<p>For the Animate Project I exported it as a Canvas using these settings</p>
						<p>I followed a guide on deploying Animate Projects here</p>
						<a>...</a>
						<br>

						<a>How you managed assets during project work</a>		
						<p>-I used folders to organise all of my assets and made </p>
						<p>I created backups for all of my drawings by keeping the original photoshop file so I could go back and edit it if I needed to change it.</p>
						<p></p>
						<br>


						<a>Design Decisions:</a>
						<br>
						
						<a>How you used the elements and principles in your designs.</a>		
						<p>-</p>
						<br>

						<a>How your designs are consistent with conventions and existing material</a>		
						<p>-I based my character on these two .</p>
						<p>The character I used in the previous animation</p>
						<p>The main character from TLoZ Link</p>
						<p>I </p>
						<br>

						<a>What decisions you made about aesthetics and experience</a>
						<p>-I originally wanted the charcter to move around based on arrowkeys instead of arrows but</p>
						<p>I was not able to set up the collisons with the objects around.</p>
						<p>Because this did not work I went for a button (arrow) that the user can click to go in a direction.</p>
						<p>I created multiple characters on the title screen for giving the effect that he was lost and walking around.</p>
						<p>I was tempted to use the same character from the last animation but his sprite size was too small and did not fit in with the surroundings.</p>
						<p>This is why I decided to draw my own character based on hime.</p>
